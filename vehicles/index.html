        This demonstration is of Braitenberg Vehicles, which are a
        concept first described by Valentino Braitenberg in terms of
        building intelligent-seeming robots from very simple logical
        parts. It's often used as a demonstration of how complex or
        intelligent behaviour can arise from basic reactive agents.
        Reactive agents use very simple logic with no memory, planning
        or model of the world in order to determine their actions. These
        are typically considered to be very limited in their behaviour
        and ineffective at solving any problems, however this is a
        demonstration of how they can produce seemingly intelligent
        actions.
    </p>
    <p>
        The different agents can be described with the following
        behaviours:
        <ul>
            <li>Love or Seek</li>
            <li>Aggression or Hatred</li>
            <li>Fear or Hide</li>
            <li>Explore or Observe</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
</div>
