    <p>The three respective panels show:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The best route found so far via a genetic algorithm search.
        </li>
        <li>A random variation considered in the genetic algorithm.</li>
        <li>
            A 2-approximation produced via a MST method. The green lines
            represent some edges of the MST, however many are covered by
            edges used in the route.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The fact that the third panel shows a 2-approximation is quite
        significant. Its score must be within a factor or 2 of the
        optimal Traveling Salesperson route, so it can be used to
        approximate the effectiveness of the route found by the genetic
        search.
