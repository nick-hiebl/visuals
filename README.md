### [Wolfram Cellular Automata](#wolfram-cellular-automata)
[See here.](https://nick-hiebl.github.io/visuals/wolfram/)
This is an implementation of cellular automata as described in Stephen
Wolfram's book "A New Kind of Science". Rules are given codes which are
based upon responses for a cell to the three cells above it. The codes
for 12 particularly interesting rules have been added as buttons for you
to try out, though a full list of all rules and pictures as well as
some explanation and analysis can be found in many places online as well
as Wolfram's textbook itself.
